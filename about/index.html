	<h2>About Me</h1>
</div>

<p>Hi, I'm Alexander Grebenyuk. Thank you for vising my site!</p>

<p>I'm a passionate software engineer with many years of professional experience building software and leading teams in both large companies and small startups. I truly love software. I enjoy <a href="https://github.com/kean">writing it</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}archive/index.html">writing about it</a>.</p>

<p>I am originally from Moscow but got a chance to live in other places, like Kraków, Poland and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/agrebenyuk/16455839655/in/dateposted-public/">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>

<p>Open source has been a major part of my life.<p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kean/Nuke">Nuke</a> is the project that I am most proud of. It's been recognized by the community. There are two tutorials on Nuke on <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/library?q=nuke&sort_order=relevance">www.raywenderlich.com</a>. GitHub named Nuke 7 one of the <a href="https://github.blog/2018-06-12-release-radar-may-2018">best releases</a> in May 2018. Nuke was on the list of top trending frameworks on GitHub a number of times.</p>

<p>I started working with Open Source in 2013 and Nuke is just one of the many projects I authored and continue to maintain. Other projects include:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kean/Arranged">Arranged</a> – UIStackView replacement</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kean/Align">Align</a> – AutoLayout framework</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kean/FutureX">FutureX</a> – type-safe Futures in Swift</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/kean/Regex">Regex</a> – open source regex engine</li>
    <li>And about <a href="https://github.com/kean?tab=repositories">12 other projects</a> which you can find on my GitHub page</li>
</ul>
