<h2 id="h_about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Software developer from Moscow. I have experience of working for both small startups and large internet companies. Of particular interest to me is Swift, which I started to experiment with from the day one. I am committed to the open source development and I've personally authored <a href="https://github.com/kean">multiple frameworks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_projects">Projects</h2>

<h3 id="fitmeup"><a href="http://www.fitmeup.ru">Fitmeup</a> by CleverBits (Objective-C)</h3>

<p>My contribution included some of the most complex screens, session management, storage, <a href="https://kean.github.io/blog/core-data-progressive-migrations">migrations</a>, support for in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, and more. I've also set up a continuous delivery for this project using <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my_world"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/moj-mir/id598556821?mt=8">My World</a> by Mail.Ru (Objective-C)</h3>

<p>Our team was responsible for developing from the ground up a full featured iOS client for a social network. Some of my more notable contributions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Photosafe</em> (cloud photo storage), which I drove end-to-end as lead of iOS developer group. One of its most challenging requirements was offline support with fast and reliable sync. My suggestion - which we went with - was to use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers-v1/core/docs#delta">delta updates</a> with a single endpoint. We also faced other challenges like setting up concurrent Core Data and optimizing it for large datasets, clustering photos on a map, and more.</li>
<li><i>Instant Messenger</i> on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>. It had to be optimized for an iPhone 4 - common at the time. The solution included background layout calculations and memoization. We shipped it in just over a month.</li>
<li>I personally drove most of the media features. The most prominent one was <i>Image Editor</i> which I made from the ground up. It featured non-destructive edits, intermediate cache, multiple adjustments including Core Image filters, etc.</li>
<li>I authored multiple modules used in the project including an image loader that was later <a href="#df_image_manager">open sourced</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="storymaker">Storymaker by Mail.Ru (Objective-C)</h3>

<p>Over the last 4 months at Mail.Ru I was involved in prototyping a new blogging app. We've completed most of the core functionality, but it was never released to the public.</p>

<h3 id="vincent_decor"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/vincent-decor/id480639136?mt=8">Vincent Decor</a> by Aplica (Objective-C, C#)</h3>

<p>One of its most intriguing features was <i>Decorator</i>. The user would take a picture of a room and the app would automagically put decorative effects on the walls. It was built using OpenGL ES 2.0 which I had no prior experience with. I quickly got familiar with it and even incorporated some performance best practices including VAO, VBO, mipmapping.</p>

<p>I was also responsible for some of the back-end development using C#.</p>
