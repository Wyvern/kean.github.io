TODO: If you remember MRR (Manual Retain/Release), you know that under the hood ARC inserts these retain and release calls for you. 

TODO: If you ever profiled your code, you know that memory management can take a significant amount of processor time.

TODO: In this article we will learn how ARC works under the hood in the most recent Swift version. ARC is a [moving target](TODO:link), the improvements are made constantly. If you are optimizing your code, always verify.

Ok, but how are we going to inspect it?
